One of the hardest things I have ever done was admitting that I had a problem. At the same time, admitting I had a problem with drugs, realizing I was powerless over them and realizing that my life was utter unmanagable while I was using was the first step out of the pit of sadness, dispair, and impending death. Admitting I had a problem was freeing.

Addiction is a brain disease. It's a cronic, progressive, and fatal disease that affect the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves.  It is characterized by cumpulsive drug seeking and use despite negative circumstances.  Often addiction plays out in a cycle of craving, use, negative consequences.  More negative consequences often intensifies the urge to use, so this cycle is a feedback loops that leads to a downward spiral into heavier and heavier use.

There is no cure for addiction.  A number of treatment options exist to help individuals stop using, to stop feeding their addiction.  Abstinence alone is rarely enough.  Work is required to quiet the obsession to use, treat underlying mental health issues, and stay clean for long term. Some find cognitive behavior therapy or medication to help.  I work the steps of cystal meth anonymous and alcoholics anonymous.  By working these programs and helping others work the program, I have found my obsession to be largely lifted; I pray that continues for life.


## How can you help?

Getting clean is hard.   I found the stress of work, especially in a performance driven, high-pressure environment to be detrimental to my early recovery.  In the United States, getting treatment for a substance abuse addiction is covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  I'm fortunate enough to be at a company where I can take medical leave in order to focus on my recovery during the first couple of months of my recovery.  Obviously, not everyone will have this opportunity, but if they need it, and it's possible at the company level, managers and supervisors who facilitate employees taking the time they need are invaluable resources for people in need of time to heal.

Addiction has broad-reaching impact on a person's life.  From their physical health, mental health, and relationships to their overall well-being, every aspect of their life is affected.   As allies, being an ear to listen, providing space without prying, and XXXXXXX helps addicts in recovery to recovery safely and know they are safe.  Ultimately, the decision to disclose one's recovery status is a personal one and some people may simply feel more comfortable keeping this information private.

## Why may coworkers choose to disclose their status?

First, they may need supoort.   This support could range from requesting time off for treatment, added flexibility to their schedule in order to attend Twelve Step or other meetings, treatment appointments, or other time committments, or requesting accomodations to help manage their recovery.  Additionally, disclosing their recovery status can be a way to build trust with coworkors or supervisors, especially if there was some trust lost while they were active in their disease.   By sharing the experience and vulnerability, they may feel that they can build stronger connections with others in the workplace.

Addiction if fraught with stigma and discrimination as well as guilt and shame on the part of many addicts.  By being open about their recovery, many feel they can act as examples for others who may be suffering that recovery is possible, role models of recovery for their colleagues to help reduce the stigma.  By recovering openly, others who may have a problem may see them as a resource they can confide in; the core of Twelve Step programs is that we are addicts helping other addicts, and living openly gives us the opportunity to be of service to others who are suffering.   As coworkers and supervisors, you can help by offering empathy, compassion, and understanding.   Pity is of no help, I encourage you to Read Brene Brown's Atlas of the Heart if you are unsure about the difference between compassion and pity -- they are often confused emotions, but one serves to drive connection and healing and the latter shatters it.  Think "me too" versus "you poor thing."

Above all, respect boundaries.   Recovery is a personal journey and everyone's needs and boundaries are different.   Coworkers can suppor their colleague by respecting their boundaries.  This may include not offering them alcohol at work events, not questioning coworker's choices to abstain (regardless of any shared recovery status) or giving them space when they need it.   Recovery is an emotional process and sometimes those emotions are brought up seemingly randomly; giving someone the space to process what they're feeling and not interjecting into their space gives them room to breathe.  Offer your coworker motivation and encouragement.  If they share milestones, likes months in sobriety, celebrate with them. Even simple words of encouragement can help them feel supported and less alone.
