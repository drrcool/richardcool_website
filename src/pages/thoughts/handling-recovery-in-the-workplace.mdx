One of the hardest things I have ever done was admitting that I had a problem. At the same time, admitting I had a problem with drugs, realizing I was powerless over them and realizing that my life was utter unmanagable while I was using was the first step out of the pit of sadness, dispair, and impending death. Admitting I had a problem was freeing.

Addiction is a brain disease. It's a cronic, progressive, and fatal disease that affect the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves.  It is characterized by cumpulsive drug seeking and use despite negative circumstances.  Often addiction plays out in a cycle of craving, use, negative consequences.  More negative consequences often intensifies the urge to use, so this cycle is a feedback loops that leads to a downward spiral into heavier and heavier use.

There is no cure for addiction.  A number of treatment options exist to help individuals stop using, to stop feeding their addiction.  Abstinence alone is rarely enough.  Work is required to quiet the obsession to use, treat underlying mental health issues, and stay clean for long term. Some find cognitive behavior therapy or medication to help.  I work the steps of cystal meth anonymous and alcoholics anonymous.  By working these programs and helping others work the program, I have found my obsession to be largely lifted; I pray that continues for life.


## How can you help?

Getting clean is hard.   I found the stress of work, especially in a performance driven, high-pressure environment to be detrimental to my early recovery.  In the United States, getting treatment for a substance abuse addiction is covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.  I'm fortunate enough to be at a company where I can take medical leave in order to focus on my recovery during the first couple of months of my recovery.  Obviously, not everyone will have this opportunity, but if they need it, and it's possible at the company level, managers and supervisors who facilitate employees taking the time they need are invaluable resources for people in need of time to heal.
